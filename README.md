# Pokedex

## An interactive pokedex that holds the collection of approximately 800 pokemons!

With Pokemon being one of the most popular cartoons and storyline around the world, Pokemon has extended into multiple branches, ranging from games like Pokemon Go to movies. In the storyline, there exists a pokedex, an interactive device that pokemon trainers can access to learn more about pokemons and keep track of the pokemons the user has seen. Utilizing Xcode's Storyboard to create the UI and basic structure of the mobile application, I created a pokedex that not only shows, but has fields where Users can search pokemon, watch their GIF, and even filter their results according to type and other features of the Pokemon. Leveraged knowledge in Protocols, Delegates, NavigationControllers, and MVC model and written in Swift.
